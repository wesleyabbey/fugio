# **Fugio**

**This is a project for HackNC.** 

It is a currency management application that extracts and displays information using the Capital One "Nessie" API. A client side user can then conveniently monitor their account activity, transaction history, as well as check their current balance. After a user peruses through their account activity, they can determine the purchases that led them to the unfortunate predicament of not being able to pay their *mortgage*.
